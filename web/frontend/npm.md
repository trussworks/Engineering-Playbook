## Enabling 2FA

Following best practices Truss requires that we enable 2FA when it is available. NPM allows enabling 2FA for both logging in, as well as publishing NPM packages. We can't force the enrollment, so enrollment is done so on the honor system. Please enable 2FA for _both_ logging into NPM as well as publishing packages.

Docs to do so exist [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-two-factor-authentication)
