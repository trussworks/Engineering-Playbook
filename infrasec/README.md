# [Engineering Playbook](../README.md) / InfraSec

## Overview

Infrastructure and security engineering (infrasec) is the practice of
building secure, robust systems that are foundational to having reliable
applications and services. While infrastructure as code is a core area
for this practice, it also involves system design, [incident
response](../incident-response/README.md), and a number of other fields.

## The InfraSec Practice

## Immutable Infrastructure

- Containers (Docker)
- Functions as a Service (Lambda, etc)

## Cloud Providers

- [AWS](./aws/README.md)
