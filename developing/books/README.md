# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Books

## Overview

As a human, one of the best ways I learn and improve is by reading books. I am more likely to enjoy and benefit from books that are recommended by people I trust and work with.

This directory is intended to be a central place with a list of recommended books makes it easier and more scalable for people to share and discover them.

## Scope

Being part of the Engineering Playbook, these suggestions may skew towards more technical topics over time, but in the near terms there may be other topics represented here (e.g. "how to teamwork", "how to share mental state", etc) that appeal to a broader base of Trussels who may not consider themselves "engineers".

## Access

Many of these books will be available via [O'Reilly Online Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/individuals.html) (fka Safari Books Online), which has individual subscription plans available for $39/month (at the time of this writing) and can be expensed.
