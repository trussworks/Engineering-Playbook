# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Programming Languages

## Overview

This section will contain our collective observations about the strengths and challenges offered up by many of the different programming languages out there.

While Truss may have opinions on particular languages and strategic reasons for investing in some languages over others, we recognize that our clients will may make different choices for different reasons. As such, Trussels should aim to be proficient in more than one language and able to get by with several.

## Languages Trussels are proficient in

* [Go](./GO.md)
* JavaScript (including TypeScript/FlowScript)
* Swift
* Rust
* Kotlin
* [Ruby](./ruby/README.md)
* [Python](./python/README.md)
* Java
* C/C++
* [bash](./BASH.md)

## Language Resources

### Go

If you are new to Go, these are resources that can help you get started:

1. [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org) (in-browser interactive language tutorial)
1. [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) (info about the Go environment, testing, etc.)
1. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) (how to do things “the Go way”)
1. [Daily Dep documentation](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html) (common tasks you’ll encounter with our dependency manager)
1. [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/go/about) offers a series of exercises with gradually increasing complexity

Additional resources:
