# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Programming Languages

## Overview

This section will contain our collective observations about the strengths and challenges offered up by many of the different programming languages out there.

While Truss may have opinions on particular languages and strategic reasons for investing in some languages over others, we recognize that our clients will may make different choices for different reasons. As such, Trussels should aim to be proficient in more than one language and able to get by with several.

## Languages Trussels are proficient in

- Go
- JavaScript (including TypeScript/FlowScript)
- Swift
- Rust
- Kotlin
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- C/C++

## Language Resources

### Go
If you are new to Go, these are resources that can help you get started:

1. [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org) (in-browser interactive language tutorial)
1. [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) (info about the Go environment, testing, etc.)
1. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) (how to do things “the Go way”)
1. [Daily Dep documentation](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html) (common tasks you’ll encounter with our dependency manager)
1. [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/go/about) offers a series of exercises with gradually increasing complexity

Additional resources:

* [Go Pointer Primer](https://github.com/trussworks/go-pointer-primer)
* [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com)
* [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/) (where you can read the docs for nearly any Go package)
* Check out the [Go wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Learn)
* Advanced Testing with Go [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yszygk1cpEc) and [Article](https://about.sourcegraph.com/go/advanced-testing-in-go) (great overview of useful techniques, useful for all Go programmers)
* _Book_: [The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/)

* Promises
  * [An incremental tutorial on promises](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2016/08/28/incremenal-tutorial-to-promises/)
* Spread Operator/Rest Params
  * [JavaScript & The Spread Operator](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-spread-operator-a867a71668ca)
  * [How Three Dots Changed JavaScript](https://dmitripavlutin.com/how-three-dots-changed-javascript/)
* Template Literals
  * [Template Literals](https://css-tricks.com/template-literals/)

### Python

#### Versioning and management
We usually recommend [Pipenv](https://hub.docker.com/r/kennethreitz/pipenv/) in combination with Docker.

If for any reason a project is not using Pipenv+Docker to manage Python, then the overriding recommendation must be that *EVERY engineer on that project* ensure that they are using the **exact** same Python install/version and management strategy (be it virtualenv, pyenv, etc) as each other or else it will be a major pain point in debugging issues.
