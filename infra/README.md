# [Engineering Playbook](../README.md) / Infrastructure/Deployment

## Overview

Infrastructure/Deployment is rilly rilly important - much too important for humans to do. If at all possible - automate it.

Click [here](./getting_started/README.md) to get started with AWS and Terraform.

To see examples of Truss' common infrastructure patterns, click [here](https://github.com/trussworks/truss-infra).

## Immutable infrastructure techniques

- Packer
- Containers (Docker)
- Functions as a Service (Lambda, etc)
- [Terraform](./tf/README.md) How we use Terraform to make infrastructure manageagble and repeatable.

## Infrastructure as code techniques

- [Terraform](./tf/README.md) How we use Terraform to make infrastructure manageagble and repeatable.
- CloudFormation
- Concourse-CI
- Circle-CI

## Cloud Providers

- [AWS](./aws/README.md)
- GCP
- Azure
