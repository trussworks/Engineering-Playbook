## Contributing guidelines

If you run into a bug with any of our published terraform modules, please open an issue in the relevant repository or open a pull request addressing the issue. We get notifications about these issues and new PRs in our company slack, so we should get back to you within a few days. If we don't get back to you within a week, please tweet us [@truss_works](https://twitter.com/Truss_Works) and we'll look into the delay!

For more information about how we publish releases or work with terraform modules, please see the [README](./README.md).
