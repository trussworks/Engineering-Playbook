## Integrating With Your GSuite Account

Truss GSuite administrators are required to enable security keys on their accounts. Configurations require modern versions of Safari, Chrome or Firefox. You can follow [Google’s instructions](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) on getting it setup.

Non-admin Gsuite accounts are not currently required to use security keys for 2fa, but folks are starting to adopt Yubikeys as many of the usability/compatibility issues have been resolved.
