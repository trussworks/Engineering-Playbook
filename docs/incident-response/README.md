# Incident Response

## Overview

Incident response is an important part of maintaining a reliable, secure
service. There are a number of components to incident response, starting
with how we prepare for incidents with on-call, through the actual process
of responding to service or security incidents, to how we follow through
with the post-incident retrospective (aka postmortem) process.
