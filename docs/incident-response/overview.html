page</button></div><div class="theme-doc-markdown markdown"><h1>Overview</h1><p>Incident response for production systems owes a great deal to the incident
response process developed by the National Forest Service and later
standardized by DHS for all emergency services, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incident
Command System (ICS)</a>.
This document will describe how we adopt this process to work for our
projects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-an-incident">What Is An Incident<a href="#what-is-an-incident" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Is An Incident" title="Direct link to What Is An Incident">​</a></h2><p>Before we describe incident response, we should define what exactly
constitutes an incident. An incident is a service disruption, usually
with user impact, that needs to be addressed outside of the normal
sprint process, and requires an increased degree of coordination and
communication.</p><p>This definition is intentionally vague because there&#x27;s no hard and fast
rule about what qualifies for the incident response process. Basically,
if the initial responders think this framework will be useful in taking
care of the problem, they should invoke the incident response process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="roles">Roles<a href="#roles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Roles" title="Direct link to Roles">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="incident-commander">Incident Commander<a href="#incident-commander" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Incident Commander" title="Direct link to Incident Commander">​</a></h3><p>The incident commander runs the incident response. This <em>does not</em> mean
that they are leading the investigation; in fact, they should not be
investigating at all directly. Their responsiblities are:</p><ul><li>Keep track of the current state of the incident response; what is the
impact to the service and users? What is the state of any mitigations
or attempted fixes? How are the other members of the incident response
team holding up?</li><li>Make any final decisions about incident response. No one should put in
place any mitigations, attempted solutions, or active diagnostic
measures <em>without</em> running it by the IC first. This is imperative to
ensure no one is working at cross purposes and that the current state
of the system is understood.</li></ul><p>During especially severe incidents, the commander may also have a deputy
to assist with their tasks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-leadinvestigator">Technical Lead/Investigator<a href="#technical-leadinvestigator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technical Lead/Investigator" title="Direct link to Technical Lead/Investigator">​</a></h3><p>There may be one or more investigators on any one incident. These are the
people responsible for actual diagnosis of problems and implementation of
any mitigations or attempted fixes for the cause of the incident.</p><p>If there is more than two investigators on the incident, one should be
designated as the technical lead. This will be the person who reports to
the incident commander and coordinates the investigation to keep people
from duplicating effort or stepping on each other&#x27;s toes.</p><p>Before taking any <em>active</em> measures to investigate, the investigator(s)
should coordinate with the incident commander to make sure they are aware
and approve of taking the action.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="communicator">Communicator<a href="#communicator" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Communicator" title="Direct link to Communicator">​</a></h3><p>The communicator is responsible for handling external communication during
the incident, both by keeping the rest of the engineering team informed
and notifying stakeholders (such as clients) about the status of the
incident. Similarly, if non-responders want to ask questions or notify
the incident response team of issues, they should use the communicator as
a conduit to the incident commander, not talk to the commander directly.</p><p>During less severe incidents, the communicator role may be folded into
the scribe role.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="scribe">Scribe<a href="#scribe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scribe" title="Direct link to Scribe">​</a></h3><p>The scribe is responsible for recording what is going on during the
incident, both so that the incident response team has something they can
reference during the incident, and for the use of the person coordinating
the retrospective after the incident is over. While most communication
during the incident should be taking place somewhere it can be easily
recorded (such as Slack), parsing through hundreds or thousands of Slack
messages to find the one that is important can be difficult. The scribe
should highlight notable events in the incident process, such as:</p><ul><li>when the incident is first noticed</li><li>when the incident response begins and ends</li><li>when the impact of the incident changes (for the better or worse, or
new symptoms appear)</li><li>when mitigations or attempted fixes are applied</li><li>any other events that have a significant impact on the progress of the
incident</li></ul><p>These should be recorded somewhere easily available to the rest of the
team; a Google Doc is usually the best place, since it can be added to
or commented on collaboratively.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="severity">Severity<a href="#severity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Severity" title="Direct link to Severity">​</a></h2><p>Incidents are usually graded on a 3-5 point scale, with SEV1 being the
most severe type of incident. This may be decided on a project-by-project
basis, since clients may have specific reporting requirements around
certain incident severities. In general, the severity index should look
something like this:</p><ul><li>SEV1 - Complete service outage or major security incident. Requires an
immediate response at the highest priority.
<em>Example: Service containers stuck in a crash loop, PII data known to
have leaked.</em></li><li>SEV2 - Significant service degradation or severe known security
vulnerability. Requires an immediate response at high priority.
<em>Example: 20% HTTP error rate, library with known remote exploit in
use.</em></li><li>SEV3 - Service is in a degraded state but is not currently impacting
users. If further issues occur, is in danger of reaching SEV1 or SEV2.
Should be addressed promptly, but not necessarily immediately.
<em>Example: One member of a database replica pair is down.</em></li></ul><p>Additional severity levels are left to the project&#x27;s discretion.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="process">Process<a href="#process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Process" title="Direct link to Process">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="starting-the-process">Starting the Process<a href="#starting-the-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Starting the Process" title="Direct link to Starting the Process">​</a></h3><p>An incident begins with someone being notified of an issue, usually by
monitoring or a user complaint. The initial responder then notifies the
rest of the team in an appropriate channel (projects should have their
own channel designated for incident coordination) and begins the
incident response.</p><p>Immediately after declaring the incident, the responder should find an
incident commander. This could be the initial responder, but they may be
better suited for taking the lead investigator role if they have already
started trying to diagnose the problem. If they are going to be the
incident commander, they should find someone (such as the secondary
on-call) to take the lead on the investigation.</p><p>The incident commander should then find a scribe and communicator. For
smaller incidents, this could be one person. The initial responder should
give the scribe as much context to begin recording the opening stages of
the incident, and the scribe should start the incident record and make a
link to the document available to responders.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="during-the-incident">During the Incident<a href="#during-the-incident" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to During the Incident" title="Direct link to During the Incident">​</a></h3><p>The incident response team&#x27;s priorities during the incident should be
as follows:</p><ul><li>Assess the impact of the incident (affecting random 10% of users, the
us-west-2 region, users whose accounts were created today, etc)</li><li>Mitigate the impact to the service (failing over to another region,
placing the service into read-only mode, rolling back to a previous
known good version, etc)</li><li>Attempt to diagnose the problem via passive measures (reading logs,
probing read-only endpoints, examining metrics, etc)</li><li>Take active measures to diagnose the problem (pushing config or code
changes, submitting data to see how the system responds, etc)</li><li>Take action in an attempt to resolve the problem.</li></ul><p>The response process during the incident should basically be a 15-20
minute loop that looks something like this:</p><ul><li>The technical lead or investigators report to the incident commander
on the current state of the service. Special attention should be paid
to changes in status (it is getting better or worse, affecting a new
set of users, spreading to another region, etc).</li><li>The team reviews the status of any mitigation or solution efforts that
were put in place during the previous iteration of the loop.</li><li>If the incident is not yet resolved, the team determines what their
course of action will be for the next 15-20 minutes; any new active
measures need to be approved by incident commander.</li><li>Team members go back and take their appropriate actions, and start
the loop over again in 15-20 minutes.</li></ul><p>In general, you do not want to repeat this loop in more often than once
every 15 minutes, otherwise your team members will be too busy checking
in to actually do what they need to. Repeating less often means that the
situation can change too much between check-ins, which is bad for the
incident commander&#x27;s situational awareness.</p><p>If the incident is resolved, it&#x27;s usually a good idea to wait an
additional 15 minutes before you disband the response team, just to
make sure it&#x27;s <em>actually</em> resolved, and not just a temporary blip. If
things are quiet after that, you can move to the post-incident steps.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="after-the-incident">After the Incident<a href="#after-the-incident" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to After the Incident" title="Direct link to After the Incident">​</a></h3><p>Once the incident is over, the incident commander should wind down the
incident response and notify the rest of the engineering team and any
stakeholders that the incident response is ending.</p><p>Each member of the team should review the incident record and make sure
that any of their own notes are in the record. The scribe should reread
the log of incident communication and make sure they have highlighted
the important events in the record.</p><p>The incident commander should create a ticket to generate a retrospective
and add links to the incident record as well as the first Slack message
that started the incident so that the facilitator for the retrospective
