# Templates

## Overview

This section contains templates to be used when extending this Playbook by adding new subject areas (directories) or adding new topics (files) to existing subject areas.

To add a new topic to an existing subject area, copy [`topic.md`](./topic.md) to the subject area (directory) you wish to extend. Rename, edit the content and finally, be sure to add an entry to the local `README.md` file for the subject area where the topic lives.

Similarly, to add a new Subject Area, copy the `subject` directory to the containing subject area. Again, rename, edit the content and add it to the local `README.md`

## Contents

- [Topic](./topic.md)
- [Subject Area](./subject/README.md)
